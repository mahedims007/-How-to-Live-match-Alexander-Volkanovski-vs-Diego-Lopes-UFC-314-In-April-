# -How-to-Live-match-Alexander-Volkanovski-vs-Diego-Lopes-UFC-314-In-April-

The fight is for the now-vacant UFC featherweight title after Ilia Topuria vacated the belt to move up to lightweight. This fight is important for both fighters; Volkanovski wishes to gain back his old self, and Lopes is looking to win his first UFC belt.
Alexander Volkanovski's Story
Record and recent form: Volkanovski (26-4) is a former UFC featherweight champion who maintained the title for more than four years and defended it five times. But he is coming off two knockout defeats in a row — first to Islam Makhachev in October 2024 at lightweight, and then to Ilia Topuria this past February at featherweight. This fight comes more than 14 months after his last one.
Motivation: Volkanovski is 36 and has admitted this may be his last opportunity to recapture the title. He has taken on an "Old Man Volk" attitude, trying to show that he can still shine in his night days. He still believes his experience and tactical ability is enough to outlast younger adversaries.

Record and Momentum: Lopes (26-6) is on a five-fight win streak, with wins over Dan Ige and Brian Ortega. Renowned for his aggressive style and knockout power, Lopes has quickly climbed the featherweight ladder since joining the UFC less than two years ago.
Fighting Style: Lopes' elite jiu-jitsu grappling coupled with his striking power provides him with dangerous capabilities on the feet and rap grids. Questions about his cardio, however, have hung over him, despite a tendency toward improvement in his last few bouts.
Keys to Victory
For Volkanovski: Twitchy experts among us say Volkanovski should dart out, drag Lopes deeper than ever with his footwork and ack-ack tactical gunplay. It will be critical not to engage Lopes in the early going, where he is most dangerous, since Volkanovski’s durability has been called into question after a pair of knockouts in quick succession.
For Lopes: Lopes needs to continue the momentum of Volkanovski's recent fights by pressuring early and making him pay with his knockout power. His ability to blend striking with grappling could also make life difficult for Volkanovski.
